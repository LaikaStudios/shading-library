The Production Shading Library refers to [Laika's](https://www.laika.com) entire collection of VFX production shading capabilities. This repository will contain those portions of Laika's Production Shading Library that have been released as open source.

This release contains a set of shading nodes based on [Pixar's](https://www.pixar.com) [RenderMan](https://renderman.pixar.com/product) that provide:

- [Material Layering System](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/prman_23.Home)
- [Annotate displayfilter](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/prman_23.Home)

If you make use of this repository, I strongly urge you to [subscribe to the discussion group](https://groups.google.com/group/laikastudios-shading-library). Please use this group to provide feedback on any bugs you may find or to discuss any feature requests.

# Documentation
Documentation is on the [wiki page](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/prman_23.Home).

# Building Instructions
The Production Shading Library at Laika is developed in a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) environment.
Specifically, [Fedora](https://getfedora.org). This initial release does not contain any facilities for building in other operating system environments.
That said, as long as the necessary `c++` compatible compiler and `make` and `rsync` commands are available,
it should be trivial to build the shading-library code on other platforms.

To build the contents, execute

    make clean; make

in your local checkout directory of the shading-library. This will put the built contents into a `build` sub-directory.

# Environment
Assuming you checked out this git repository to `~/shading-library` and have built it, katana's execution environment should have the following environment variables set. Make any alterations necessary for your specific set of software.

Using `bash` shell:

    # Shading-library installation location.
    export SHADING_LIBRARY="${HOME}/shading-library"

    # Pixar installation location.
    export PIXAR_ROOT="/opt/pixar"

    # RenderMan version.
    export RMAN_MAJOR="23"
    export RMAN_MINOR="2"
    export RMAN_MICRO=""
    export RMAN_VERSION="${RMAN_MAJOR}.${RMAN_MINOR}${RMAN_MICRO}"

    # Katana version.
    export KATANA_MAJOR="3"
    export KATANA_MINOR="2"
    export KATANA_MICRO="v4"
    export KATANA_SHORT_VERSION="${KATANA_MAJOR}.${KATANA_MINOR}"

    # RenderMan and shading-library software locations.
    export RMANTREE="${PIXAR_ROOT}/RenderManProServer-${RMAN_VERSION}"
    export RFK_LOCATION="${PIXAR_ROOT}/RenderManForKatana-${RMAN_VERSION}-katana${KATANA_SHORT_VERSION}"
    export RMAN_RIXPLUGINPATH="${SHADING_LIBRARY}/build:${RMANTREE}/lib/plugins"
    export RMAN_SHADERPATH="${SHADING_LIBRARY}/build:${RMANTREE}/lib/plugins:${RMANTREE}/lib/shaders"

    # Katana resource locations.
    export KATANA_RESOURCES="${RFK_LOCATION}/plugins/Resources/PRMan${RMAN_MAJOR}:${SHADING_LIBRARY}/katana"
